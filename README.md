## Problem Statement
Students and parents can use this web app to find out everything about institutions, including tuition and housing prices, eligibility, campus placements, scholarships, support services, and rules. The app helps students choose engineering and management universities in India and abroad, based on qualifying exams, technical expertise, and other details.  

The app generates a college list based on entrance exam results, eligibility criteria, fees, rankings, and region. Students can register for colleges after checking qualifications and taking an aptitude test (AT) that assesses verbal, quantitative, and general knowledge.
